    Project Instructions
    2. Algorithm Implementation:
        • Implement five sorting algorithms in Python: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort,
        Radix Sort, and Linear Search Algorithm.
        • Ensure your code is well-commented to explain your logic and the theoretical
        complexity of each algorithm.
    3. Visualization Tool Development:
        • Utilize matplotlib or Pygame to create a visualization tool that demonstrates the
        sorting algorithms in action.
        • The tool should allow users to start, pause, and reset the visualization process.
    4. Performance Analysis:
        • Measure the execution time of each algorithm with arrays of various sizes and
        conditions using Python's time module.
        • Document your findings and prepare a comparative analysis.
    5. Presentation Preparation:
        • Summarize the project's objective, methodology, key findings, and reflections on
        the efficiency and practical applications of the sorting algorithms.
        • Prepare a live demo of the visualization tool to include in the presentation.
    6. Demo Video:
        • Record a video of the live demo showing the sorting algorithms' visualization.
        • Upload the demo video on LinkedIn with a post explaining the project and its
        significance. Include the hashtag #CSUF to highlight your affiliation and project
        theme.
    7. Presentation Submission:
        • Compile your findings, analysis, and demo into a PowerPoint presentation not
        exceeding 8-10 minutes.
        • Ensure the presentation is well-structured, engaging, and includes all necessary
        information to understand your project fully.
